The main idea of the project is to show run time and efficiency of each Sorting Algorithm by applying same and different input size of data. By, apply Bubble Sort, Insert Sort, Select Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Heap Sort to our data we can figure which Sort algorithm is good to our data set. In the graphs below you can see that by increase the size of input data the Time Complexity will increase regarding the size.
